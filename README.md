# shopping-list

In this exercises I am trying to improve my JS skills. Thi issue with this exercises is, I must create an HTML  file that includes an `ul` and an `div` in that there are a `label`, an `input` and a `button`. 
I will try to create a page that takes an input and retuns it on the page as a bullet list with an extra **Delete** button next to it. 
The bullet list must be created with JS and if I click the Delete button the item must be deleted from the page.
